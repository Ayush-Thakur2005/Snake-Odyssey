Snake Odyssey is a modern take on the classic snake game, built using Python and Pygame. In this game, you control a snake that grows longer with each piece of food it eats. The objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or your own snake body, while trying to achieve the highest score possible. The game offers a smooth, addictive experience with simple controls and vibrant graphics.

Features:
Simple controls: Move the snake with the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Endless gameplay: The game continues as long as the snake doesn’t hit the walls or itself.
Increasing difficulty: As the snake grows, the challenge increases.
Score tracking: Keep track of your score and compete to beat it!
Colorful visuals: Retro-inspired graphics make the game more visually appealing.
Smooth animations: Experience a seamless, fluid game with responsive controls.
Minimalistic design: Focus on gameplay, with no distractions.
How to Play:
Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
Eat the red food that spawns on the screen to grow longer.
